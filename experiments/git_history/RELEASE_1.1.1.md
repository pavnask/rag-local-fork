# üîñ Patch Notes: `v1.1.1`

## üõ† Improvements
- Restored **AI-generated diff summaries** to the top of the Markdown report.
- Integrated both AI commit summaries and **Standards Evaluation: Rule vs AI** into a unified report.
- Localized summary output to Russian:
  - Section headers (`–ò–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –∫–æ–º–º–∏—Ç–µ`, `–û—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–≤`)
  - Verdicts (`–ü–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–æ`, `–ö–æ–Ω—Ñ–ª–∏–∫—Ç`)
- Added handling for missing AI responses and unstructured systems.

## üß™ Verified
- Markdown summary now includes both YAML change context and standards evaluation.
- Validated on 3 files, 19 systems, with matching and conflicting results.
